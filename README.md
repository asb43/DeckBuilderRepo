This project is meant to test the waters on a game designed around a gameplay loop similar to Slay the Spire
Not all mechanics are currently thought out as of yet (this will be updated if the situation changes)
There are many free assets found online that are currently used in this project for the sake of getting the gameplay off the ground
If this project develops further, then the assets will be gradually replaced with original ones
